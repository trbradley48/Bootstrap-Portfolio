            <p class="wrappedP">Hello! My name is Taylor Bradley. I was born in Rancho Cucamonga, California and grew up
                in Vancouver, Washigton. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the
                Universtiy of Washington in 2016. I have worked at T-Mobile as a Systems Architecture for the past two
                years. I have gained a ton of industry experience and what to expect working in this field, but sadly I
                feel I have left my roots of programming. </p>

            <p class="wrappedP">Now that the technical stuff is out of the way I can talk about my interests! My biggest
                hobby is music. I've been playing guitar for 10+ years along with a handful of other instruments. My
                main genre of music I play is metal! Sadly I don't have enough time or know enough people in Seattle to
                join a band, but always down for a good jam sesh!</p>

            <p class="wrappedP">Some other passions of mine are learning about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
                Mathematics) and video games. Ever since I got to college I fell in love with math and science. I am
                constantly learning about STEM topics on my free time. Another hobby of mine is playing video games.
                This hobby goes back to my childhood. I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I
                grew up playing all types of games but in the peak of my interest I was a big FPS guy. The first 3 Halos
                were my game of choice.</p>
